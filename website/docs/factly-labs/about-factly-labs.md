# About Factly Labs

Factly Labs is the technology wing at Factly that works on various solutions for Journalism Tech. Factly Labs was started to primarily address the technolgy needs at Factly, but we quickly realized that the solutions developed for Factly addressed similar problems across other media organisations. We also believed that the solutions developed for Factly would benefit media organisations of all sizes. We have since developed various open source projects and will continue to develop more solutions while building a vibrant open source community around these projects.

## Factly Labs Mission

Factly Labs strives on developing and managing various applications that will increase access to public data and information by making it easy, interactive and intuitive.

## Factly Labs Vision

Factly Labs will strive to democratize journalism technology.
