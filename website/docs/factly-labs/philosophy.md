# Our Principles of Open Source

Our core principles are centered around the idea of collaboration, transparency, accessibility, and releasing early and often. These principles are reflected in our open source projects, which typically have the following characteristics:

## Collaborative Development

Our open source projects are developed and maintained by a community of volunteers who work together to improve the software. These volunteers may be individual users or organizations, and they contribute to the project in various ways, such as writing code, submitting bug reports, or providing documentation.

## Open Access to Source Code

One of the defining features of our open source software is that the source code is publicly available. This means that anyone can view, modify, and distribute the code, as long as they abide by the terms of the license. This level of transparency allows for greater collaboration and innovation, as well as increased security and reliability.

## Release Early and Often

We believe in releasing our software early and often, so that users can try out new features and provide feedback. This allows us to iterate quickly and incorporate user feedback into our development process.

## Inclusivity and Diversity

Our open source projects are inclusive and welcoming to contributors from all backgrounds and experience levels. This diversity of perspectives and experiences can lead to more innovative solutions and better-quality software.

## Community-Driven Governance

The development and direction of our open source projects are determined by the community of contributors. This can take various forms, such as a formal governance structure or a more informal decision-making process. In either case, the goal is to ensure that the project remains true to its core principles and serves the needs of its users.

## User-Focused Design

Our open source projects are designed with the needs and preferences of users in mind. This can involve soliciting feedback from the community, conducting user research, or implementing user-friendly design practices. The goal is to create software that is easy to use, reliable, and effective.



Overall, our core principles emphasize collaboration, transparency, accessibility, and releasing early and often, and these principles are reflected in our open source projects. These projects are developed and maintained by a diverse community of volunteers, and they are designed to serve the needs of their users.
