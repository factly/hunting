# Key features

Hunting is an open-source library that provides data profiling as a REST API. It offers a range of powerful features for data profiling, including univariate and bivariate analysis, missing value analysis, correlation analysis, and prefetching for profiling large datasets. These features allow users to quickly and easily generate comprehensive reports on the structure and content of their data, and can help users gain a better understanding of their data and identify potential issues and trends.

## Univariate Analysis

Hunting provides detailed reports on the distribution and characteristics of individual columns in a dataset. It includes a range of statistical measures, such as mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and percentiles, and provides visualizations to help users understand the distribution of their data.

## Bivariate Analysis

Hunting allows users to analyze the relationship between two columns in a dataset. It provides a range of statistical measures, such as correlation coefficients and p-values, and provides visualizations to help users understand the relationship between their data.

## Missing Value Analysis

Hunting allows users to identify and analyze missing values in their data. It provides detailed reports on the distribution and characteristics of missing values, and provides visualizations to help users understand the impact of missing values on their data.

## Correlation Analysis

Hunting provides detailed reports on the correlations between columns in a dataset. It allows users to identify strong and weak correlations, and provides visualizations to help users understand the relationships between their data.

## Customization of Output

One of the key features of Hunting is its support for customization of the output of the profiling report. This allows users to select which columns and statistics to include in the report, and to customize the appearance and formatting of the report. This makes it easy for users to generate reports that are tailored to their specific needs and preferences, and can help users create the exact visualizations and statistics they need to gain insights into their data.

## Prefetching

Hunting includes support for prefetching, which allows users to profile large datasets without running into memory constraints. When enabled, Hunting will prefetch a specified number of rows from the dataset before profiling, allowing it to profile large datasets without using excessive memory. This makes Hunting well-suited for profiling large and complex datasets, and allows users to generate detailed reports on their data quickly and efficiently.

Overall, Hunting is a powerful and versatile tool for data profiling, and offers a range of features to help users gain a better understanding of their data. Whether you are looking to analyze the distribution of your data, the relationships between your data, or the impact of missing values, Hunting has the tools you need to quickly and easily generate detailed reports on your data. Its support for customization of the output of the profiling report and for prefetching also makes it well-suited for generating reports that are tailored to the user's specific needs and preferences, and for profiling large and complex datasets.
