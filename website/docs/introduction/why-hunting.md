# Why was Hunting created?

Hunting was created to provide an easy and intuitive way to gain insights into the characteristics and patterns of data. It was built on top of the Pandas Profiling and Polars libraries, and is designed to be a powerful yet user-friendly tool for data profiling.

One of the key features of Hunting is that it provides data profiling as a REST API, allowing users to access data profiling capabilities from any device or platform that can make HTTP requests. This is important for several reasons. First, it allows users to integrate data profiling into their existing applications and systems, making it easy to incorporate data profiling into their existing workflows. For example, users can use Hunting to profile their data as part of a data pipeline, or as part of a data-driven application. This can help users gain a better understanding of their data in real-time, and can help them identify potential issues and trends as they arise.

Second, the use of a REST API makes Hunting highly accessible, allowing users to access data profiling capabilities from any device with an internet connection. This makes it easy to use Hunting from anywhere and at any time, and allows users to incorporate data profiling into their remote workflows and collaborations.

Finally, the use of a REST API makes Hunting highly scalable and performant, allowing it to handle large and complex datasets with ease. This means that users can use Hunting to profile datasets of any size and complexity, and can generate detailed reports on their data quickly and efficiently.

Overall, Hunting was created to provide a valuable tool for anyone working with data, and to help users gain a better understanding of their data through data profiling. It offers a simple and intuitive way to uncover the hidden patterns and insights in data, and can help users make more informed decisions and drive better business outcomes. With its powerful data profiling capabilities and easy-to-use REST API, Hunting is a valuable tool for anyone working with data, and can help users gain a deeper understanding of their data, identify potential issues and trends, and make more informed decisions.
